TITLE: Determinants of global sea level rise and implications on the planet. 

WHAT IS OUR PROJECT ABOUT?
1. We would like to assess and visualise the two common root causes for global sea rise (surface temperature increase and loss in ice/glacier) 

2. We would like to look at the implications of rise in sea levels on loss in land/population/gdp 

WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF OUR DATA?
1. NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory: https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaaglobaltemp.html 
2. Historical Seal Level Rise: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sea-level-rise?tab=table&country=~OWID_WRL

WHAT STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES WILL WE BE USING?
- We will aim to forecast the change in sea level for the upcoming years. For this, we will be either relying on time-series analysis or regression techniques.
